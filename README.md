## Description

__KooCook!__ is a web application that helps people—whether they are amateur cooks, homecooks, aspiring cooks, experienced cooks, or just starving people—decide on what food they want to make with the ingredients, equipment, time, and preferences that they have and live a healthier life with nutrition information included.

**This repo** is considered a submodule for the [main app](https://github.com/KooCook/koocook/tree/dev) and act as a backend (backbone) of the project.

## Notes

### About branching

Our team decided to change from using GitHub Flow to Git Flow, so our main branch is `dev` (mainly for development) and not `master` (production-only)
